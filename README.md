### Hi there, welcome on my profile ðŸ‘‹

After a formation at [O'clock](https://oclock.io), where I learned alot of the web development ecosystem, from front-end to back-end, SEO, Sys Admin, etc..
I  currently work for [Mediterranean Shipping Company](https://www.msc.com/) as fullstack developer on the ServiceNow cloud-based platform.
I love Javascript, and always want to push my limits by creating new things and never stop to learn.
